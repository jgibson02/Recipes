# Cream Scones with Salted Caramel Topping

### Ingredients:
##### Scones:
* *2 cups all-purpose flour*
* *2 tsp baking  powder*
* *1 tbsp sugar*
* *1/2 tsp salt*
* *6 tbsp butter*
* *2 eggs, beaten*
* *1/2 cup heavy cream*
* *1/2 tsp vanilla*

##### Salted Caramel Topping:
* *1 cup granulated sugar*
* *1/2 cup heavy cream*
* *2 tbsp unsalted butter*
* *3/4 tsp kosher salt, or to taste*

### Instructions:
##### Scones:
Preheat oven to 400Â°. Butter a cookie sheet lightly. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Work in butter with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add eggs, cream, and vanilla and stir until well blended. Place on a lightly floured board or countertop and knead for about a minute. Roll dough flat to a thickness of about 3/4-inch and cut into rectangles. Place on cookie sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes.

##### Salted Caramel Topping:
###### Step 1
In a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat, combine the sugar with 1/4 cup cold water and stir to combine. Cook, without stirring, until the sugar has turned a deep amber hue, approximately 10 to 12 minutes.
###### Step 2
Meanwhile, warm the cream in a small saucepan. When the caramel is ready, slowly whisk in the warm cream and continue simmering the mixture until it is smooth, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, then whisk in the butter, and then the salt, to taste. Serve warm.
