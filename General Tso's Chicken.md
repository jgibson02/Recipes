# General Tso's Chicken

### Ingredients:
##### Marinating:
*  *3 kg of chicken cut into 1-2 inch cubes*
*  *About 2 tbsp light soy sauce*
*  *1 egg*
*  *Black pepper*

##### Sauce:
*  *2 tbsp of dark spy sauce*
*  *2 tbsp oyster sauce*
*  *1 tbsp rice wine vinegar*
*  *1 tbsp vinegar*
*  *2 tbsp sugar*
*  *1 cup water*
*  *1 tbsp minced garlic and minced ginger*
*  *1 tbsp of corn starch*
*  *3-4 red chili/dried chili*
*  *About 3 green onions/scallions/spring onions (same thing different names)*
*  *2 tbsp oil*

### Instructions:
##### Marinating:
Put all this in a bowl and leave it to marinate. The egg is used to bind the flour to the chicken once you're ready for frying. I would leave it to marinate for an hour but I was tired af so I overslept after shopping and left it to marinate for 12 so do as you wish.
Once you're ready for frying you will need the following ingredients:
*  *Frying oil- enough to fry. I used cold pressed rape seed oil but I suggest you use a good frying oil that you can get your hands on*
*  *Corn starch 1cup*
*  *All purpose flour 3cups*

Get the chicken and in the same bowl it was marinated in put the cup of corn starch inside and stir the chicken around. Get another bowl/tin and place the flour in. Cut the chicken pieces in the flour making sure you leave no wet spots. Once the oil is hot enough around 350 degrees, place the chicken pieces in. Cook them for 4min and take them out. Leave them for now.

##### Sauce:
Now get another bowl and put the soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice wine, sugar, vinegar, water and corn starch in and give it a stir. Now put the pan/wok on the heat, medium heat, and put the oil in the pan. Add the green onion and the chilies to the pan and cook them for 2 minutes. Put the sauce in and heat until it is thick. Put the chicken in and stir the sauce around making sure you cover all the chicken with the sauce, garnish with sesame seeds and green onion.
