### Ingredients
##### Stew
*   *2 1/2 lbs of stew meat*
*   *1 lb of small red potatoes*
*   *4 carrots*
*   *4 stalks of celery*
*   *2 small yellow onions*
*   *4 cloves of garlic*
*   *1/2 lb of baby Bella mushrooms 1 bag of frozen peas (thawed) 1/2 cup flour*
*   *2 cups of red wine (preferably one you actually like to drink)*
*   *Few dashes of worcestershire 2 tbsp of butter*
*   *1 quart of beef stock*

##### Seasoning
*   *2 tbsp smoked paprika*
*   *1 tbsp all spice*
*   *1 tbsp of garlic powder*
*   *2 bay leaf*
*   *2 sprigs of Rosemary*
*   *4 sprigs of thyme Salt, and lots of pepper*

### Instructions
Start by seasoning the beef with salt and pepper and then searing the meat in the pot ( I used olive oil here). You can do this in a couple of batches to not overcrowd the pot. After searing the meat, use a slotted spoon and remove it from the pot into a separate bowl.
At this point, you throw in the diced onions and cook until translucent, then you can put in the roughly chopped garlic and cook until fragrant. Here, throw in the mushrooms butter and spices and cook down for but, then sprinkle in he flour and cook that down.

Now you put in the red wine, and beef stock, and I added a couple cups of water. Bring the ingredients to a bowl for about 5 minutes, then lower heat and let simmer forever. Longer the better. While the stew is simmering put in the herbs tied up together with some kitchen twine.

About an hour before you are ready to eat, you can throw in the potatoes cut in half, carrots and celery, and put in the peas 30 min after that. This is so the vegetables still have a nice bite to them.

And through out cooking you can add a dash more of each of the spices to bring those flavors out again.
